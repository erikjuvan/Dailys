## C++ Namespace without a name
It's called: unnamed namespace / anonymous namespace. It's use is to make functions/objects/etc accessible only within that file. It's almost the same as static in C.

## C++ Using
It's basically the same as typedef (I think it's nicer) except it offers some additional things with templates.
~~~c++
using mytype = int;
